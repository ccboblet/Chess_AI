# Chess_AI
This project will be split into 3 parts: gui, rules, and AI. The gui and rules classes will contian all the information for 2 people to play each other on a computer. The gui will hangle detecting moves using a mouse to drag and drop a piece on the desired square. The rules will determine if that move is a legal chess move and return the new position to be displayed by the gui.The AI will enable a person to play against the computer.

The gui class uses tkinter to create a window to interact with the user. A canvas is used to display the board squares and piece images. There are 3 bindings used to drag and drop pieces: right mouse click, mouse movement with the right button held down, and right mouse release. The select binding find the piece clicked by the user and puts it on top of the other images. The hover binding makes the center of the selected piece follow the mouse. The teleport binding determines the destination square and passes that to the rules class to determine if it is a legal move. There is all a promotion binding to allow the user to select the piece they wish to promote their pawn to become. The gui tracks the position of the board using a dictionary to link each image with its piece type.

The rules class is under developement.
